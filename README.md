# Fake-News-Detection-
Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to create a neural network-based deep learning model to classify news articles as either genuine or fake. The proliferation of fake news on digital platforms poses significant risks to society by spreading misinformation and influencing public opinion. This project aims to develop a robust and scalable fake news classification system to automatically identify and flag misleading content.

Business Use Cases
An effective fake news classification system can help:

Reduce the spread of misinformation.
Protect public opinion from manipulation.
Enhance the credibility of digital news platforms.

Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Understand data distributions and relationships between variables.
Feature Engineering:

Create new features that could enhance the predictive power of the model.
Model Development:

Baseline Model: Develop a simple model as a baseline for comparison.
Deep Learning Models: Implement RNNs and Transformer-based models.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Evaluate the performance of various models using appropriate evaluation metrics.
Model Selection: Compare models based on their performance metrics.
Hyper-parameter Tuning:

Fine-tune the model's hyper-parameters to optimize performance.
Results
The project aims to develop a high-performing fake news classifier capable of:

Achieving a high F1-score to balance precision and recall.
Handling diverse and large-scale datasets efficiently.
Providing reliable predictions that can be integrated into news platforms to flag potentially fake news articles.
